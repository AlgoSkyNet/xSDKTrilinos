The second example (Program \ref{PETSc_Amesos2Ex.cpp}) demonstrates how to use
PETSc datatypes with Trilinos packages that require a Tpetra::CrsMatrix.  One
such package is Amesos2, which contains a variety of direct solvers (and
interfaces to external direct solvers).  In this example, we will solve a linear
system $Ax=b$ where $A$ is the 2D discretization of the Poisson operator on a
unit square, and $b$ is a random vector.

\paragraph{Lines 1--71}
These lines are very similar to the previous example, where we set up convenient
typedefs and create the PETSc Poisson2D matrix.

\paragraph{Lines 74--82}
Create a random solution vector $x$ and its corresponding RHS $b$.

\paragraph{Lines 85--89}
Deep copy the PETSc Mat and Vecs to Tpetra::CrsMatrix and Tpetra::Vector, so
that we can use them with the Amesos2 linear solvers, which require a
Tpetra::CrsMatrix.

\paragraph{Lines 95--100}
Create an Amesos2 linear solver, specifically the native solver KLU2.  Perform
the symbolic and numeric factorizations, then solve the linear system.
