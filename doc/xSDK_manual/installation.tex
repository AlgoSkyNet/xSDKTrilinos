\chapter{xSDK Installation}
The easiest way to install the various xSDK libraries is to use the
configuration script provided at
\url{http://xsdk-getting-started-guide.readthedocs.org/}.  
If you would prefer to manually install Trilinos and enable the PETSc, hypre,
and SuperLU interfaces, you may specify those options in the Trilinos configuration
script; an example script is presented as Program \ref{config-script}.

\begin{lstinputlisting}[caption=Sample
configuration script,label=config-script]{src/do-configure}
\end{lstinputlisting}

Let's examine this script in more detail.  The first thing we do is define
where the Trilinos source code is located.  Then, we set the paths to the
include directory and library directory for each package we wish to enable. 
Here, we have decided to enable PETSc, hypre, and SuperLU\_Dist.  Since
SuperLU\_Dist requires METIS and ParMETIS, we must enable them as well.
The first couple of arguments to CMake are standard Trilinos arguments
documented in the Trilinos Configure, Build, Test, and Install Reference Guide
(found at \url{https://trilinos.org/docs/files/TrilinosBuildReference.html}).
Third Party Libraries are addressed in in section 5.13 of that manual.  For each
TPL we wish to enable, we add {\tt -D TPL\_ENABLE\_[TPL\_NAME]}, {\tt -D
[TPL\_NAME]\_LIBRARY\_DIRS}, and {\tt -D [TPL\_NAME]\_INCLUDE\_DIRS}.  We
explicitly enable the packages Amesos2 and xSDKTrilinos because they contain the
interfaces to SuperLU\_Dist, hypre, and PETSc.
